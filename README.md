# Single Page Transitions
Inspired by [this](https://www.cssscript.com/demo/full-page-slide-transitions-with-css3-and-bespoke-fx/) and [this](https://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/) so I tried to implement it myself too. Tried to do so without using bootstrap or any other CSS frameworks, lets go #bootstrapless. (lol)

- [x] Slide Left and Right
- [ ] Slide Up and Down

CSS/JS tricks learnt:
